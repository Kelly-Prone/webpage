      <strong>Hello! =)</strong>
     </p>

     <p>
        My name is Kelly, I live in Limeira-Brasil and I'm 23 years old.
        This site is to tell a little more about me ... it is simple, because I am still learning to program.
     </p>

     <p>
        My dream is to get to know Harvard, but I was very happy to find out about the CS50 course and to be able to share a little of what I know.
        Currently, I am studying my first year in "Software Engineering" and I am studying the maximum to get at least one "summer job" in companies like: BMW, Google, Apple, etc ...
     </p>

     <p>
        I love studying, and I know it can help me have a better future!
        I'm also a musician, I've been playing the cello since 2015 and before that I already played the trumpet, I had the honor of meeting professors from Pennsylvania (West Chester University) and making friends with some people from New York.
